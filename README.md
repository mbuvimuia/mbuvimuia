# Hey there! I’m Innocent Mbuvi 👋

I’m a **Data Engineer** at heart who loves building things—whether it’s pipelines, models, or solutions that make data work harder. I blend **Data Science** and **Analytics** skills to create stuff that’s practical and impactful. Think of me as a builder with a toolbox full of Python, R, and AWS.

## 🛠️ What I Build With
- **Core**: Python (pandas, scikit-learn), R, SQL  
- **Engineering**: Docker, AWS, Apache  
- **Viz**: PowerBI, Matplotlib  

## 🌟 Stuff I’ve Built
- **[Adidas Customer Segmentation & Recommendation System](https://github.com/mbuvimuia/Adidas-Customer-Segmentation)**  
  Led a team to craft a customer segmentation pipeline and recommendation model in Python.   
- **[Northwest County Housing Market Predictive Analysis](https://github.com/mbuvimuia/Northwest-County-Housing-Analysis)**  
  Engineered a regression model to predict housing prices—50k+ data points wrangled with Python.  
- **[SyriaTel Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/mbuvimuia/SyriaTel_Customer_Churn_Prediction)**  
  Built a churn classifier with 90% precision. Turned data into retention wins with clean visuals.  

## 🔧 Why I Love This
- Designing systems that handle data like a pro (hello, Docker and AWS).  
- Solving problems with ML—classification, regression, clustering, you name it.  
- Keeping it real with insights that actually matter.  

## 🚀 What’s Next
I’m diving into **Deep Learning** and beefing up my engineering game—think scalable pipelines and smarter models.
